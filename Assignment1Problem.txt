Problem 1:
 
There are two types of bricks -- small and big. Each small brick is 1 inches long, and each big brick is 5 inches long. 
 
You are given an X number of small bricks and Y number of big bricks. You are required to construct a row of bricks that is Z inches long.
 
Create a function that will return "true", if the given number of X small bricks and Y big bricks are able fill the row of Z inches long. Otherwise, return "false".
 
Example 1: Given 2 small bricks and 1 big brick and desired row length of 7, the function should return true.
createRow(2, 1, 7) should return true
 
Example 2: Given 2 small bricks and 3 big bricks, you cannot create a row of 13 inches.
createRow(2, 3, 13) should return false
 
Example 3: Given 4 small bricks and 2 big bricks, you can create a row of 12 inches.
createRow(4, 2, 12) should return true
 
 
createRow((smallCount, bigCount, rowLengthInInches) {
}
